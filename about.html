        <p>For those wishing to book it is of the utmost importance for one to note that membership to the society of crossed keys is a requirement to stay in this exquisite establishment. We had a splendid stay and rather enjoyed our nightly dining experience followed by gentle dip in the spa. </p>

        <p>When thinking of the delicious food prepared by the Serbian chef, only the remarkable Lloyd's in Temesvary, Transylvania, springs to mind. The wine list is amazing and post-prandial (or pre-breakfast) palinca is not to be missed. Our rooms were spotless and the fully-renovated spa is second to none.</p>
